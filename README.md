# CS50P_WEEK4_LIBRARIES
This is week4 of the CS50P which was about the Modules, Command-Line Arguments, Packages, PyPI ,and APIs, this repo contains the project files that i have designed to implement the theoretical knowledge This week's projects are designed to reinforce your understanding of Python programming concepts while exploring practical applications. Let's delve into the projects from the past:

### 1. Emojize

In `emojize.py`, I created a program that allows users to convert text input into emoji representations. The program prompts the user to input text in English, including any emojis specified as codes or aliases. For example, typing `:thumbs_up:` is converted to the corresponding üëç emoji. The `emoji` library was used for this purpose.

### 2. Figlet

In `figlet.py`, I implemented a program that generates ASCII art text using the FIGlet font library. This program allows users to specify the text to be displayed and optionally choose a specific font. If no font is specified, the program randomly selects one from the available fonts. The `pyfiglet` library was utilized for generating ASCII art.

### 3. Adieu

`adieu.py` is a program that bids farewell to a list of names provided by the user. The program prompts the user to input names, one per line, until the user terminates input (e.g., using `Ctrl-D`). Then, it formats the farewell message based on the number of names inputted.

### 4. Number Guessing Game

In `game.py`, I implemented a number guessing game. The program prompts the user for a level, representing the upper bound for the random number to be guessed. After that, it generates a random number within the specified range and prompts the user to guess that number. The user receives feedback on their guesses until they correctly guess the number.

### 5. Little Professor

`professor.py` simulates a math problem-solving toy called "Little Professor." The program prompts the user for a difficulty level and generates ten math problems for the user to solve. If the user fails to solve a problem within three attempts, the correct answer is displayed.

### 6. Bitcoin Price Calculator

In `bitcoin.py`, I implemented a program that calculates the cost of buying a certain amount of Bitcoins. The program expects the user to specify the number of Bitcoins they want to buy as a command-line argument. Then, it queries the CoinDesk API to fetch the current price of Bitcoin and calculates the total cost.

These projects offered a diverse range of challenges and helped me deepen my Python skills.
